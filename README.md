# Bala
I’m Mike Bala, a programmer/musician. Although I’ve made some games in the past, I’ve always dreamt of making games for the Sega Mega Drive or Master System. Nowadays those dreams can be achieved more easily with the help of tools like SGDK etc.
<br/>
My main goals when making a game are:
- [x] Addictive gameplay
- [x] To make something a bit different

For now I'm running a one man show but I surely could have some help in the future, especially in the graphic department.
